/* 
Welcome to our small coding challenge for the position of full stack developer at Splinde.
This task of developing a prototype is timeboxed and should be completed within roughly ~3 hours.
Please do not overspend time. We want to see how you work with constraints, not how much overtime you are willing to invest.

Below we provide you some demo data which you should serve via an API and render in the browser via React.
Which tools or frameworks you use beside Typescript and React is up to you.
Do not modify the demoData. Design the frontend in such a way, that deeper nested trees may be rendered. 
It is up to you to modify the types if needed. 
Please create a git repository and push it to a public git respository and send us the link when you are done.
Also provide a brief README file with instructions how to install and run your app.
In the technical interview you can present your solution and we can discuss your decisions.

Must haves:
- Create backend endpoint that serves the demoData (Can be a static JSON endpoint or simple in-memory API)
- Compute computedSum of sections and the total sum and render the total sum (frontend or backend)
- Create frontend and render sections with computed sums
- If users edit a sum of an entry (onBlur), the computed sums should be updated (frontend only)
- Users can edit notes

Optional tasks (If time left pick tasks you like or get creative):
- Make the UI look nice :)
- Create docker compose setup
- Collapse/expand sections (Frontend only)
- Add/remove entries/sections (Frontend only)
- ...
